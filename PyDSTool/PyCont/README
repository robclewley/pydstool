Recent Changes
--------------

New Version:
    - Works with SciPy 0.5.2
    - AUTO works on 64-bit machines
    
Version 0.3.1:
    New functionality (please see Wiki for details):
	- Two plotting methods were added to plot_cycles:  'stack' and 'highlight'.
	- Added continuation argument 'StopAtPoints', allowing computation to stop at specified special points.
	- Added domain checking through introduction of a new special point labeled 'B' for 'Boundary'.  Note
	  that if 'B' is active (through specification in LocBifPoints), domain information is saved along the
	  curve with the labels 'inside' and 'outside'.
	- Added continuation argument 'description' allowing the user to give details on the specific curve
	  computation.  When the info() method is called from the curve class, the description will be displayed.
	- Added argument SPOut to the LimitCycle class, allowing the user to stop at specified values of variables
	  or parameters.
	- Jacobians with respect to variables is now implemented in AUTO interface.  Jacobians with respect to 
	  parameters is currently not working, but will be added very soon in a minor release.
	- Added get() method to plot class.

    Bug fixes:
    	- Fixed NAN issue on linux.
	- Fixed bug with refresh() method in plot class.  Had difficulty with suplots.
	- Fixed bug in setting of axes titles.Version 0.2.1:
    - Added example PyCont_LotkaVolterra.py (gonna use this as test example for variable and par bounds)
    - Added example PyCont_PredPrey.py (example with Zero-Hopf point)
    
Version 0.3.0:
    - Limit cycles using AUTO is now implemented (see PyCont_MorrisLecar_Dopri.py, PyCont_Lorenz.py, and
    PyCont_ABReaction.py)
    - Added more plotting capabilities (see Plotting.py and the Wiki for more information)
    - There are a number of syntax changes.  Please see the Wiki for details.
    
Version 0.2.2:
    - An initial direction can now be specified for a new curve.  This is useful for following multiple
    branches.  See PyCont_Logistic.py
    - Added SaveJacobian and SaveEigen parameters
    - Added computeEigen method to curves.  Once the eigen information is computed, you can plot the
    stability of the fixed points by activating the plot_stability flag in the call to display()
    - Added an exportGeomview() method to export the curves to a Geomview data file (default is geom.dat)
    - Discrete maps are now implemented (curve class FP-C) with the fold, flip and torus bifurcations 
    detected.
    - Added pseudo-arclength continuation (Keller method).  This is unstable right now (trouble detecting
    bifurcation points).  Use only when MoorePenrose gives strange output.
