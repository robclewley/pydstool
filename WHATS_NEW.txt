version 0.87 10 Nov 2008
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Major new features:
 * ModelInterface class and new-style Models - major restructure of
   how Models are organized and can be hierarchically embedded in
   each other

 * Feature & condition classes with ModelInterface ease specification
   of hybrid models and complex parameter estimation & model
   inference problems

 * Support for 2nd order interpolated polynomial representation of
   Trajectory objects (using Anne Archibald's poly_int classes):
   These are off by default as they require a large amount of time
   to compute. See tests/poly_interp_test.py (Auxiliary variables
   cannot be included in this, and remain linearly interpolated,
   as their derivatives are not generally available.)

 * Descriptors, Transform classes for automated model building and
   manipulation of specifications

 * MProject sub-package for managing model estimation/inference
   projects

 * All generators now return trajectories that only continue until
   any user-defined state bounds are reached. The state bounds are
   not found with the same accuracy as terminal events defined to
   trap these bounds errors, which is the recommended way to
   implement this (e.g., through ModelConstructor options).

 * Default interval checking is now off (use 'checklevel' option 1
   or 2 to return to consistency checking with warnings) to improve
   speed of ODE solving

Feature and API improvements and fixes by module:

Model.py:
 * Improved interaction between domain boundaries and event detection
   for hybrid model switching at those boundaries (esp. for VODE)
 * Hybrid model classes and functionality cleaned up and re-organized.
   Hybrid models are now a sub-class of Model so that they can be
   organized hierarchically, with Generator-only based models as the
   leaves. All methods and attributes involving name "Generator" now
   replaced with "submodel" or "DS" (for dynamical system).
 * HybridTrajectory sub-class behaves like a proper Trajectory
 * Fixed bug in recording of events for hybrid models
 * Now all sub-models of a hybrid system must "export" the same
 * Can promote a Generator's auxiliary variables to be treated as
   observable or internal vars at Model level, provided all
   sub-models export them. forceObsVars and forceIntVars used to
   promote the aux vars or to change internal <-> observable variables
   (now has no effect if variables already of desired type)
 * Method delTraj -> _delTraj deprecated because del model[trajname]
   now works
 * Removed method numPartitions (instead, use
   len(getTrajTimePartitions(trajname)))
 * Added renameTraj method
 * fulldimension -> dimension (= # of obs + int vars)
   genInfo tuple -> modelInfo dict (see technical documentation for details)
   generators list attribute -> registry dict attribute

Trajectory.py:
 * Regular continuouss trajectories can now be called as a map (0 or
   1 only) to yield endpoints

 * Can now delete variables from a Trajectory

 * Now support FScompatibleNames map (primarily for internal use by
   Model objects)

 * Fixed bug in trajectory calling as map (appending of time to vals
   works in place and so previously, result was None)

 * Attribute .varnames -> .coordnames

PyCont:
 * New PyCont example for finding level sets of functions
 * Fixed minor bug in PyCont/AUTO for continuing limit cycles

Generators:
 * Generators now support queries in hierarchical name format
 * Fixed bug in event detection for VODE integrator
 * Fixed access to external inputs for C-based ODE integrators before
   first integration performed

Points.py:
 * Can now rename variables in pointsets and points
 * Fixed bug in pointset's label reversal

Interval.py:
 * Fixed small bug concerning singleton interval comparison
 * Added isfinite method

FuncSpec.py:
 * Fixed obscure error in cross-referenced aux fns
 * Fixed abs -> fabs mapping error in vector field functions
 * Allowed scripts using C-based Generators to be re-run provided
   definition of Generator has not changed (used to always raise an
   error)


version 0.86  01 Jun 2008
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 * Now compatible with Python 2.5 and Numpy 1.0.4 / Scipy 0.6.0
 * Interval class now supports discrete valued intervals
 * Improved diagnostic reporting structure in Generator and Model classes
 * Inclusion of intuitive arithmetic operations for Point and Pointset classes
 * Improved overhead for simulating hybrid models
 * Fixed some slice bugs with Point and Pointset classes
 * Improved 'info' pretty printer utility
 * Added support for numerical rounding error tolerance in resolving independent
   variable values in Variable and Model/ModelConsturctor classes
 * Added Jacobian and standard event arguments (for zero crossing detection)
   options to ModelConstructor to auto-generate Jacobian and Jacobian w.r.t.
   parameters
 * Improved efficiency of VODE Generator in computing trajectories

Minor

 * Created a new HybridTrajectrory and HybridVariable class so that APIs are
   more in line with non-hybrid versions
 * Moved underlyingMesh for Trajectory to the Variable class
 * Fixed ModelSpec indentation
 * Fixed bug so that ImplicitFnGen Trajectories are now parameterized
 * Syntax for Symbolic and ModelSpec classes: moved target language and
   compatible types specifications to the ModelSpec class
 * Added external input support to calls to RHS, Jacobian functions, etc. in
   Generator classes
 * Moved eventtol to ModelConstructor, from GeneratorConstructor, and made abseps
   default better
 * Removed backwards compatible method names such as computeTraj, sampleTraj, and
   setModelPars from Model, in favor of compute, sample, and set
 * Auxiliary variables retained in Model trajectory computations
 * Fixed platform-dependent problems with time module that confuses the timestamp
   function in common.py (used to make auto-generated function names unique)
 * ModelSpec classes now use 'compatibleSubcomponents' and 'compatibleContainers'
   tuple attributes instead of 'componentTypes' and 'compatibleNodes',
   respectively
 * The above tuple attributes also now consist of actual classes, not their names
   -- thus they must be initialized after all the classes involved have been
   declared
 * ModelSpec now only re-validates self when flattenSpec called (speeds up model
   building)


version 0.85  10 July 2007
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 * PyCont can now perform continuation according to the zeros of user-defined
   functions or bounds (see example tests/PyCont_vanDerPol.py and
   PyCont_Hopfield.py)
 * Support for scipy.special functions in Generator definitions (Python targets
   only. C targets with a more limited range of functions will be supported soon)
 * A few phase plane analysis tools have been added to Toolbox/phaseplane.py
   -- in particular, the finding of fixed points, nullclines,
   and some simple code to compute saddle manifolds in planar systems
 * Phase response curves can now be calculated for limit cycles using the adjoint
   method (see tests/ML_adjointPRC.py and HH_adjointPRC.py for examples)
 * Generators now include auxiliary variable data in recorded event data
 * Pointset comparisons using arithmetic operators now consistent with the
   norm-based comparisons used by Points
 * Time mesh points for external inputs to integrators now forced to be integration
   mesh points for greater numerical accuracy and stability
 * VODE now supports 'use_special' for forcing values of output trajectory mesh
 * Improved support for numpy float and int types alongside standard python types
 * Improved numerical first derivative computed by central finite differences and
   Ridders' method
 * Added a multilinear regression auxiliary function builder
   (common.py/makeMultilinearRegrFn)
 * Support for parameter estimation using least squares using qualitative features
   such as positions of extrema (see wiki page ParamEst)
 * Moved ParamEst.py into PyDSTool/Toolbox, a more logical home, and removed its
   default import in PyDSTool
 * Added Toolbox/ModelHelper.py for additional model building utilities (esp.
   for neural modelling)
 * Minor bug fixes and improvements (see Trac wiki site for full change log)


version 0.84 - patch 1  13 Mar 2007
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 * Fixed PyDSTool __init__.py to ensure new numpy names are exposed,
   not the numpy.oldnumeric compatibility names from pylab
 * Fixed Radau generator for Windows platforms
 * Added functions to Model.py for changing event settings, flags, etc.
 * Fixed bugs where terminal events not associated with hybrid system
   switching raised exceptions. Now all events are by default mapped
   to 'terminate'
 * Other minor bug fixes


version 0.84  20 Feb 2007
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is primarily a release to bring PyDSTool up to date with "new Scipy"
and Python versions later than 2.4. Major code improvements are still in
development and will be released in a 0.90 version as soon as we can.

 * Compatible with Scipy 0.5.1 and Python 2.4 onwards.
 * 64-bit CPU compatible.
 * New ModelSpec building functionality, in particular "standard events"
   for threshold crossings and turning points in every variable are
   automatically generated (but detection turned off by default).
 * Improved symbolic evaluation behavior (but in this pre-0.90 version
   we have switched off some of the advanced simplification code as
   there is a bug in it which we haven't yet traced).
 * PyCont functionality improved and interface cleaned up.
 * ExtrapolateTable Generator class added
 * Various other minor fixes and improvements.


version 0.83.3 20 Sep 2006
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 * Point and Pointset behaviour modified to make access to values or arrays
   of values (respectively) easier. Now, a Point pt['x'] is not the same
   as pt[['x']]. The former now returns the numeric value, the latter a
   new Point containing only the coordinate 'x'. Behaviour with a Pointset
   pts is altered similarly, except pts['x'] would be an array of numeric
   values.
 * Pointsets can now be initialized with independent variable arrays in
   reverse order (e.g., from a backwards integration). The initializer
   method now automatically detects the reverse order and reverses both
   the independent and dependent variable arrays before creating the
   Pointset.
 * Updated FuncSpec and Generators to allow specs to be provided by lists
   of symbolic quantities,
 * Provided better support for bounds events in C and Python specifications.
   See tests/HH_model_testbounds.py and HH_model_Cintegrator_testbounds.py
 * Provided helper functions to automatically create turning-point and zero
   crossing events for oDE right-hand sides and other auxiliary functions
   from ModelSpec definitions,
 * Fixed symbolic.py to properly process string literals.
 * Fixed bugs in defining Jacobian with respect to parameters.
 * Other bug fixes for ModelConstructor, ModelSpec, Symbolic.
 * Fixed bugs in Model/Trajectory sample methods to properly use tlo and thi
   limits with precise=False option and eventdata option turned off.
 * Added data analysis toolbox for use in data-driven dynamical systems
   modelling. Moved some functions over from fracdim.py toolbox.
 * Fixed bug in using global time with hybrid systems that have external
   inputs.
 * Event definitions now support external inputs.
 * Suppressed messages to stdout from compilers and calls to minpack
   optimizers.

PyCont 0.3.1:
 * Two plotting methods were added to plot_cycles:  'stack' and 'highlight'.
 * Added continuation argument 'StopAtPoints', allowing computation to stop
   at specified special points.
 * Added domain checking through introduction of a new special point labeled
   B' for 'Boundary'. Note that if 'B' is active (through specification in
   LocBifPoints), domain information is saved along the curve with the
   labels 'inside' and 'outside'.
 * Added continuation argument 'description' allowing the user to give details
   on the specific curve computation.  When the info() method is called from
   the curve class, the description will be displayed.
 * Added argument SPOut to the LimitCycle class, allowing the user to stop at
   specified values of variables or parameters.
 * Jacobians with respect to variables is now implemented in AUTO interface.
   Jacobians with respect to parameters is currently not working, but will
   be added very soon in a minor release.
 * Added get() method to plot class.
 * Bug fixes (see PyCont/README for details).


version 0.83.2, 16 Jun 2006 (w/ patch #1)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 * Provided support for 1D Jacobians for generators (only D>1
   was previously supported).
 * Fixed bug with symbolic differentiation and simplification of expressions
   involving parsing of division of compound expressions, where braces are
   not explicitly given.
 * Points, pointsets, and parameter estimation objects are initialized
   with keywords now, not dictionaries (although points and pointsets
   retain dictionary backwards compatibility ... for now).
 * Parameterized pointsets now have the option to be referenced by values
   that are within a small tolerance of the defined independent variable
   values.
 * Improved syntax for common object methods: 'computeTraj' is now 'compute',
   'sampleTraj' is now 'sample', 'setPars' for generators is now 'set',
   'setParsModel' for models is now 'set'. Previous method names are still
   valid for now.
 * Allowed C-target FuncSpec objects to use multi-references in definitions
 * Model trajectories can now be referenced and deleted using the
   m[traj_name] notation, where m is a Model object.
 * Fixed EventMappings bug for multiple assignments specified by dictionary.
 * Update of Toolbox utilities.
 * Other minor bug fixes.
 * PyCont:

    - Overhaul of plotting so that bifurcation diagrams can be adjusted
      through a curve's 'plot' attribute.
    - AUTO is interfaced for limit cycle continuation. Requires external
      C compiler access in the same way as the Dopri and Radau integrators.
    - Improvements to the PyCont API.
    - Support for bifurcations of discrete maps


05 Apr 2006
~~~~~~~~~~~

 * Fixed bug in matplotlib_import for len(args)==0 to plot()
 * Fixed bug (again!) in Radau_ODEsystem when continuing orbits


Version 0.83.1, 30 Mar 2006
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 * Trajectory objects that can be sampled with default options
   (by calling the sampleTraj method with no arguments) are now
   acceptable plot call arguments, without first needing to be
   converted to Pointsets or arrays.
 * Updated some internal use of imports to improve compatibility with
   numarray 1.4.1 and 1.5.1.
 * Improved consistency in output of Model class for "hierarchical
   names", especially in getTrajEvents, getTrajEventTimes, forceIntVars,
   forceObsVars.
 * Minor bug fixes and improvements.

PyCont:

 * An initial direction can now be specified for a new curve.
   This is useful for following multiple branches.
   See PyCont_Logistic.py
 * Added SaveJacobian and SaveEigen parameters
 * Added computeEigen method to curves.  Once the eigen information is
   computed, you can plot the stability of the fixed points by activating
   the plot_stability flag in the call to display()
 * Added an exportGeomview() method to export the curves to a Geomview
   data file (default is geom.dat)
 * Discrete maps are now implemented (curve class FP-C) with the fold,
   flip and torus bifurcations detected.
 * Added pseudo-arclength continuation (Keller method).  This is unstable
   right now (trouble detecting bifurcation points). Use only when
   MoorePenrose gives strange output.



Version 0.83, 12 Mar 2006
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

PyCont continuation:
  * More bifurcations can be detected
  * Improved user interface / graphing capabilities
  * Exporting data to Pointsets now possible
  * Added example PyCont_LotkaVolterra.py (gonna use this as test example
    for variable and par bounds)
  * Added example PyCont_PredPrey.py (example with Zero-Hopf point)

Pointsets and Points:
  * Arithmetic and comparison operations now supported
  * Both classes now have an associated norm (defaults
    to the 2-norm) in order to implement point-wise
    comparison
  * Labelling of points better implemented
  * Calling Pointsets now only applies if they are
    parameterized, when argument must be an independent
    variable value. Other functionality previously
    associated with calling has been moved to
    [] referencing. Calling is now more efficient for
    its original intended purpose
  * Setitem for Pointsets now allows setting of entire
    coordinate or independent variable array
  * Full support for Points to be used as dictionaries
  * Better support for Pointsets to be used like arrays

Symbolic
  * Fixed handling of functions under differentiation to
    make more sense
  * Can now declare symbolic functions without defining them,
    and can differentiate them symbolically
  * Introduction of symbolic vectors and vector functions
  * Symbolic eval() more efficient, more intelligent
  * Fixed minor bugs and added many minor features

Generators
  * Definition can now be done using Quantity objects as well
    as strings
  * Initialization keyword syntax simplified, partly to reflect
    the fact that instances of class args() can be provided
    instead of dictionaries

        - 'specstrdict' -> 'varspecs'
        - 'auxfndict'   -> 'fnspecs'
        - 'xdatadict'   -> 'ics'
        - 'parameters'  -> 'pars'

  * External input signals (as arrays) can now be passed to
    the vector field in Dopri and Radau integrators
  * New ADMC++ target for Matlab (to facilitate automatic differentiation
    and parameter sensitivity calculations)
  * Fixed some Radau compilation issues on non-Windows platforms
  * Added 'method' key to InterpTable to allow piecewise-constant
    interpolation of data (key value = 'constant' or 'linear')

Tests
  * Added a couple of new test and example scripts, e.g. for
    a SloppyCell model, and for symbolic differentiation and
    manipulation.

Memory management
  * Used cPickle on non-Windows platforms to improve
    efficiency of object __copy__ methods

Models
  * No longer need to provide initial condition to
    computeTraj call for single vector field model
